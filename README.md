Yin Yang implementation
========================

## Task

Create a static class with a method that accepts two integers. Loop over each number in that range. If the number is divisible by 3, print the string "Yin" instead of the number in place. If the number is divisible by 5, print the string "Yang" instead. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print out "Yin Yang". If the file is not divisible by neither 3 nor 5, print the number as-is.
